## Extreme Programming (XP) is based on values:
> The rules we just examined are the natural extension and consequence of maximizing our values. 
> XP isn't really a set of rules but rather a way to work in harmony with your personal and corporate values. 
> Start with XP's values listed here then add your own by reflecting them in the changes you make to the rules.

## Simplicity: 
> We will do what is needed and asked for, but no more. 
> This will maximize the value created for the investment made to date. We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen. 
> We will create something we are proud of and maintain it long term for reasonable costs.

## Communication: 
> Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily. 
> We will work together on everything from requirements to code. 
> We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

## Feedback: 
> We will take every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working software. 
> We demonstrate our software early and often then listen carefully and make any changes needed. 
> We will talk about the project and adapt our process to it, not the other way around.

Respect: 
> Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member. 
> Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm. Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa. 
> Management respects our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work.

## Courage: 
> We will tell the truth about progress and estimates. 
> We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed. 
> We don't fear anything because no one ever works alone. We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.
